# PHPUnit Notes

Personal notes for unit tests with PHPUnit

## Requirements

Docker is recommended to run the unit tests.

Or simply use PHP 8 and composer on your own machine.

## Installation

```bash
make up
```

## Run unit tests

```bash
make phpunit
```

## Stop the container

```bash
make stop
```
